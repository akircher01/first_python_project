Look at the data called fixed you can view the other datasets for your own enjoyment but fixed contains a cleaner version.
This data contains occupational data and I will be primarly focusing on the hourly wage mean average and the annual wage mean average. 
After working more with this data it became apparent that some of the data need to adjusted. Some occupations were added to new job codes due to an increase in complexity and the need to distinguish them from other occupations that normally would fall in their group. I plan on working more with this data but for now I am going to submit this as it seems to meet all of the project requirements.
